            <h3>Review: </h3>
            <p>
                So I want to make something clear, I have not watched the Anime in it's entirety, I read all the manga, and have watched the 5 Dub episodes of the Anime, so while I don't think it changes my opinion, some might disagree, so there it is. And it's pretty
                good, I know the Anime can be slow at times, but the story is nice, the characters are fun, the world is interesting, and it looks really good. Sure it's not as dee as say FMA or Code Geass, nor is it as action packs as Overlord or DBZ,
                but it's just got a lot of character to it.
