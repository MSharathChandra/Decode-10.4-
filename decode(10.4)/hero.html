        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            What's a hero? For Izuku Midoriya, the answer to that question has always been simple: "Everything I want to be!" And who is the ultimate hero? Well, the legendary All Might, of course. All Might is the number one ranked hero and also the "Symbol of Peace"
            in the world. Not in his wildest dreams could Izuku have imagined that he would soon cross paths with his childhood hero... In Boku no Hero Academia, status is governed by "Quirks"—unique superpowers which develop in childhood. But, unfortunately,
            hero otaku Midoriya "Deku" Izuku never had a Quirk. That is, until he met All Might, the greatest hero of all time. Izuku's transformation from dreamer to superhero begins at Yuuei Academy, the top-ranked hero-training high school in Japan.
            Izuku is on cloud nine when he's accepted to this prestigious academy, especially when he finds out that All Might is one of the teachers. What surprises does this mighty academy offer? And will Izuku be able to keep up with his elite classmates?

            <h3>Review: </h3>
            <p>
                It is one of my favorite, why you ask, because it portrays something that has been missing in a lot of superhero anime recently: The hard work and continuous training it takes to reach the top. The story revolves around Midoriya (our protagonist) who
                receives power from the world’s best superhero. But don’t get mistaken, that is just the starting. What follows is one of the best story about the hard work and choices he has to make on his way to reach the top. On top of that, adding
                amazing action sequences to the mix really packs a punch for all the action, superhero genre lovers. I hope you get the time to watch it, as I know you won't be disappointed.
