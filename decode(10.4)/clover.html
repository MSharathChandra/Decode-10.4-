        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            In a world where magic is everything, Asta and Yuno are both found abandoned at a church on the same day. While Yuno is gifted with exceptional magical powers, Asta is the only one in this world without any. At the age of fifteen, both receive grimoires,
            magic books that amplify their holder’s magic. Asta’s is a rare Grimoire of Anti-Magic that negates and repels his opponent’s spells. Being opposite but good rivals, Yuno and Asta are ready for the hardest of challenges to achieve their common
            dream: to be the Wizard King. Giving up is never an option!

            <p>Hello Guys, This anime has mysteries story where you will find yourself so interested in it. Black Clover as of right now is a solid 8 or even an 8.5/10. The first 20 episodes of the show are very hard to get through and the animation was
                a bit dodgy at first, but I can assure you that after the first major arc of the series, the show does get better. The show comes under the ‘Shonen' category. It does receive a lot of hate for being considered as a rip off of old shonen
                shows. Like most shonen shows, it centers around a boy who works his ass off to obtain a power which no one else has. Black Clover is basically a shonen show done right. It may have its ups and downs(which I will list properly below) but
                all in all, it's a good watch if ur looking for a fun action packed anime.
            </p>
